You must create a **reproducible report** answering the following questions:

1. What is our daily overall clickthrough rate? How does it vary between the groups?
2. Which results do people tend to try first? How does it change day-to-day?
3. What is our daily overall zero results rate? How does it vary between the groups?
4. Let session length be approximately the time between the first event and the last event in a session. Choose a variable from the dataset and describe its relationship to session length. Visualize the relationship.
5. Summarize your findings in an executive summary.
